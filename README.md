## Introduction
A Generative AI-based Grievance Management System to enhance the grievance redressal process. By leveraging Generative AI, the system allows for convenient logging of complaints as well as automates complaint classification, prioritizes grievances based on urgency, and provides recommendations to facilitate faster and more effective resolutions. The solution is designed as a well-rounded system with both user and administrative functionalities. While users can seamlessly log complaints through a Grievance Chatbot, administrators can efficiently analyze grievances as dynamic text + visualization outputs (graphs, charts) through a CSV Agent, ensuring structured processing and analysis.
